A professional Admin & Dashboard template based on [Ant design 5](https://ant.design/) that comes with hundreds of UI 
components, forms, tables, charts, pages and icons. This template is built using [React](https://react.dev/), 
[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [Ant Design Charts](https://charts.ant.design/) and 
[Ant Design Icons](https://ant.design/components/icon).

# Features
- **Customizable:** You don't need to be an expert to customize the template. Our code is very readable and well-documented.
- **Fully Responsive:** With mobile, tablet & desktop support it doesn't matter what device you're using. AdminKit is responsive in all browsers.
- **Cross-Browser:** Our themes are working perfectly with Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Edge. We're working hard to support them.
- **Clean Code:** We strictly follow Ant Design's guidelines to make your integration as easy as possible. All code is handwritten.
- **Regular Updates:** From time to time you'll receive an update containing new components, improvements, and bug fixes.
